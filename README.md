# IDIG_DIP

We are using the pretrained model from **Decomposed Diffusion Sampling (DDS)** https://github.com/HJ-harry/DDS

The pre-trained model checkpoints and data are moved to a [new location](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/mlkwofr24nmsnzixj5u4d/AI-JOLUOAzklINnr8FdKpdk?rlkey=p4bj5ny58tngsjd1j46iyoqh6&st=lba2c97z&dl=0).


## Getting Started

### Download pre-trained modei weights

```
# Download pre-trained model weights
mkdir -p './exp/vp'
wget -O './exp/vp/AAPM256_1M.pth' 'https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/hs75uqc9zgwi8en71g488/AAPM256_1M.pt?rlkey=s1otrarzz1tbr7j6nwc5rh1r6&dl=1'
wget -O './exp/vp/fastmri_brain_320_complex_1m.pth' 'https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/1884de5g904fch2bah4bl/fastmri_knee_320_complex_1m.pt?rlkey=qukkxajxp6broc1fn613cdvp2&dl=1'
```

### Download sample test data

```
# Download sample test data
mkdir -p './indist_samples'
wget -O './indist_samples/data.zip' 'https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/rlxuhs5maial9cnwc533d/h?rlkey=9zovjgghncnt8ej4acdsb1a5d&dl=1'
# Extract zip file
unzip -q ./indist_samples/data.zip -d ./indist_samples
```

By default, the above scripts places the pre-trained model checkpoints under ```exp/vp```, and the sample data under ```indist_samples```. When saving to different directories, you can reflect this by modifying the ```--dataset_path``` flag for the ```main.py``` file.

## DDS and IDIG DIP reconstruction

We provide demo scripts for the following inverse problems:
- Multi-coil MRI reconstruction (2d)
- Sparse-view CT reconstruction (2d)

Each experiments can be run by simply running
```
bash eval_MRI_multi.sh
bash eval_SVCT_2d.sh
